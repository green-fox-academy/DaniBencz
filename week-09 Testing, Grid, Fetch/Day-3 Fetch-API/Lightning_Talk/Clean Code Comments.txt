CleanCode - Comments

At best, a necessary evil.

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
The purpose of a comment is to explain code that does not explain itself.

They lie, because programmers can’t realistically maintain them. Most of the time they are not worth the bits they consume.

Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all.

Truth can only be found in one place: the code. Only the code can truly tell you what it does.

// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65))
	or
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())

Types:
-explanatory(what it is, why is there, etc)
-todo (to elaborate, to review, delete, etc.)
-marking 
-loval version control
-comment-out-code
