# Tasks

## Symmetric matrix

```
Create a function named `isSymmetric` 
that takes an n×n integer matrix (two dimensional array/list) as a parameter
and returns true if the matrix is symmetric
or false if it is not.
(Symmetric means it has identical values along its diagonal axis from top-left to bottom-right,
as in the first example)
```

Example 1:

```
[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 2, 2],
  [1, 2, 5]
]
```

Output:

```
true
```

Example 2:

```
[
  [7, 7, 7],
  [6, 5, 7],
  [1, 2, 1]
]
```

Output:

```
false
```

## Most Common Character

```
Write a function that takes a filename as a parameter.
Return the most common character of the file's content.
If the file does not exist throw an exception with the following message:
"File does not exist!"
```

Example

[Example file can be found here](./countchar.txt)

Output

```
e
```

## Pirates

``` 
Write a program which can store pirates in a ship.

 Pirate:
 
 - A pirate has a name, an amount of gold and health points, the default value of which is 10.
 - A pirate might be a captain and may have a wooden leg.
 - You must create the following methods:

 - if a pirate is a captain:
    - `work()` which increases the amount of gold possessed by that pirate by 10 and decrease the HP by 5.
    - `party()` which increases the HP by 10.
 - if the pirate is not a captain:
    - `work()` which increases the amount of gold by 1 and decreases the HP by 1.
    - `party()` which increases the HP by 1.

 - if the pirate has a wooden leg, then the string that is returned by the function must look like this:
    - Hello, I'm Jack. I have a wooden leg and 20 golds.
 -  If not:
    - Hello, I'm Jack. I still have my real legs and 20 golds. 
  
 Ship:

 - It should have a list of pirates.
 - You must be able to add new pirates to the ship. It must have only one captain!
 - You must create the following methods:
 - `getPoorPirates()` which returns a list of names containing the pirates that
    - have a wooden leg and have less than 15 golds
 - `getGolds()` which returns the sum of gold owned by the pirates of that particular ship
 - `lastDayOnTheShip()` which calls the pirates' `party()` method.
 - `prepareForBattle()` which calls 
    - the pirates' `work()` method 5 times
    - then the ship's `lastDayOnTheShip()` method.
```

## Question time!

### How can you generate a random number?

If the objective is to generate a floating point number btw 0 and 1, the Math.random() function might be an option.
If a larger number is needed, one can create a function in the following manner:

function randomGenerator(max-needed-number-size){
   return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
}

where Math.floor rounds the resulting floating point number to a round integer by taking away everything after the decimal point.

### What is a ternary operator? How does it work?
